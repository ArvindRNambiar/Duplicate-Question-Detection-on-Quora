# Duplicate-Question-Detection-on-Quora
Implemented a Duplicate Question Detection framework utilizing logistic regression and random forest classifiers. Integrated advanced text preprocessing pipelines with scikit-**learn, Gensim, and NLTK. Evaluated model performance using TF-IDF and Word2Vec vectorization methods to optimize efficacy.

This repository hosts a Duplicate Question Detection framework developed to identify duplicate questions on Quora using machine learning techniques. Duplicate question detection plays a crucial role in improving the quality of content and user experience on question-and-answer platforms like Quora.

**Key Features:**
**Binary Classification Algorithms:** The framework employs binary classification algorithms such as logistic regression and ensemble methodologies like random forest to distinguish between duplicate and non-duplicate questions effectively.

**Text Preprocessing Pipelines:** Orchestrated text preprocessing pipelines are implemented, incorporating advanced techniques including text vectorization, stopword elimination, and lemmatization. These pipelines utilize prominent libraries such as scikit-learn, Gensim, and NLTK to ensure the quality and consistency of textual data.

**Comprehensive Performance Evaluations:** Extensive performance evaluations of machine learning models are conducted, employing diverse vectorization methodologies such as TF-IDF and Word2Vec. This facilitates the identification of optimal model configurations for maximal efficacy in duplicate question detection.

**Technologies Used:**
Python
pandas
NumPy
seaborn
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
scikit-learn
Gensim

**Contribution:**
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or new features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

**From the analysis, the optimal combination for achieving the best accuracy score (70%) is the use of random forest classifier model with Word2Vec for vectorisation.**
